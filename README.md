# Trust Issues -Food Edition

Understand what is actually inside packaged food.

Trust Issues — Food Edition is an ingredient intelligence system that analyzes product ingredient lists and identifies potentially harmful, allergenic, or unknown substances using NLP-based normalization and a structured ingredient ontology.

The system is designed to reduce ambiguity in ingredient labeling by mapping complex chemical names and synonyms into meaningful classifications that users can understand.

---

## Problem Statement

Ingredient labels often contain scientific or unfamiliar terminology that makes it difficult for consumers to assess safety.

Examples:
- Ascorbic Acid → Vitamin C
- Tocopherol → Vitamin E
- Casein → Milk derivative
- Maltodextrin → Highly processed carbohydrate

Users frequently struggle to identify:
- allergens
- artificial additives
- potentially harmful chemicals
- ambiguous ingredient aliases

This project aims to bridge that gap using machine learning preprocessing and structured knowledge mapping.

## Core Features

Ingredient analysis engine capable of:

• Detecting known harmful or controversial ingredients  
• Identifying allergen-related ingredients  
• Flagging unknown or unrecognized ingredients  
• Handling "may contain traces of" warnings  
• Normalizing ingredient names using NLP techniques  
• Mapping synonyms to canonical ingredient names  
• Fast lookup using Redis caching  
• Extensible ingredient ontology
